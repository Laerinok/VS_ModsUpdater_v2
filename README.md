This a third-party program. It means it is NOT a mod. You do not have to put it in the mods folder.<br>





**Work In Progress !**

Features :


* The ability to choose the update mode (automatic/manual). You can decide whether to update a mod or not.
* Downgrading mods: use a lower game version + force_update = true
* ~~A system for migrating old/custom configurations.~~ DONE
* ~~Backup of mods before updating them.~~ DONE
* ~~Improved logging and error management system~~. DONE
* ~~Improved processing, multithreading enable.~~ DONE

I still have a lot to work on; I don’t have an estimated release date yet, but progress is being made.
If you have any suggestions, now is the time to share them. If it’s within my abilities, I’ll see what I can do.
