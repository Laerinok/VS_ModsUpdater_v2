### <p align="center">Easily update your favorite mods</p>
<br><br>

=============================================================================

This a third-party program. It means it is NOT a mod. You do not have to put it in the mods folder.<br>

=============================================================================



I have resumed the development of v2. I started from scratch (again), and everything is now clearer and cleanerâ€”at least much more than the previous version. I also hope it is better optimized and faster.
For now, it is far from complete; many features are still missing, but it can already update mods automatically.


### Functional Features:
* Automatic mod updates with version locking for a specific game version
* Backup of mods before updating them
* Improved logging
* Multi-threading
* Attempt to make the script more CDN-friendly
* Possible migration from an old version of ModsUpdater: the config file is retrieved and updated for the new version (not tested on older versions of ModsUpdater)

### Features Not Yet Functional:
* Retrieving mod changelogs
* Use of arguments
* Generating a list of installed mods (PDF + JSON)
* Manual updates (I first need to solve issues with changelog retrieval)
* Planned but not guaranteed: the ability to downgrade mods for a given game version
