"""
This module manages language translations for the Vintage Story Mods Updater application, using a global cache to store and retrieve translations. It allows the application to support multiple languages by loading translations from JSON files based on the user's language setting.

Key functionalities include:
- Retrieving the language setting from the global configuration cache.
- Loading translations from a specified JSON file into the global language cache.
- Handling cases where the language file is not found or cannot be parsed, raising appropriate exceptions.
- Caching translations to avoid redundant file reads and improve performance.
- Providing a central point for accessing and managing language-specific text within the application.
