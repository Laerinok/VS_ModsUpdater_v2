"""
Module for handling HTTP requests with persistence, retries, and proper session management.

This module defines an HTTPClient class that manages requests and retries, improves error handling,
and ensures that session cookies and headers are maintained throughout requests. It can be used for
API calls, downloading files, and any HTTP requests requiring a persistent session.
