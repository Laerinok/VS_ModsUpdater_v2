v2.4.0
### Added
- feat(update): Implement mod downgrade capability (thanks to Surdjak: https://github.com/Laerinok/VS_ModsUpdater_v2/pull/39). If an installed mod is too new for the selected game version, the updater will now offer to downgrade it to the latest compatible version.
- feat(check): Add proactive incompatibility check. The application now warns the user if an installed mod is incompatible with the game version, even when no alternative version is available for download.
- feat(config): Add 'incompatibility_behavior' option. Users can now configure how the application reacts to incompatible mods: ask to continue (0), abort automatically (1), or ignore (2).
- feat (UX): Added display of the specific reason for mod exclusion in the final summary (e.g., 'Excluded by user in config.ini' or 'API data unavailable').
- Added: `--dry-run` command-line argument.
- feat (i18n): Added language support for Polish (pl_PL) (thanks to MaLiN2223: https://github.com/Laerinok/VS_ModsUpdater_v2/pull/36).
### Fixed
- fix(config): Resolved a critical encoding issue (`UnicodeDecodeError`) during configuration migration that could corrupt paths with special characters (e.g., accents). The migration process now correctly reads the old configuration file using UTF-8.
- fixed (Critical): Resolved a critical issue causing download failures for certain mods due to **double URL encoding** in download URLs retrieved from the Vintage Story mod API.
- fixed (Critical): Fixed a fatal crash (`AttributeError: 'NoneType'`) that occurred when the HTTP client failed to complete a download request after all retry attempts. Download failures are now logged and handled gracefully.
- fixed: The application now correctly displays the changelogs for all intermediate versions when updating a mod, instead of only showing the changelog for the latest version. This provides a complete picture of the changes included in an update.
- fixed (i18n): Resolved a critical issue where the 'Yes/No' prompts failed to accept universal ASCII input (like 'n' for No) when the locale used non-ASCII characters (e.g., Russian 'н'/'д').
### Changed
- refactor(config): Dynamically generate the language selection list to improve maintainability. This removes the need for manual re-numbering when adding/removing languages and ensures the default language selection is always correct.
- refactor (Logic): Reworked the mod update check logic (`mods_update_checker.py`) to sequentially pre-filter user-excluded mods. This centralizes exclusion logic and **prevents unnecessary network calls** during concurrent processing.
- refactor (Core): Centralized the entire 'Yes/No' user input logic into the robust `utils.prompt_yes_no` function and removed the superfluous and rigid validation loop from `main.py`, making the application flow cleaner and more maintainable.
- refactor (i18n): Reworked title string logic to use a dynamic variable (`{ModsUpdater_author}`) instead of hardcoding the author's name, preparing the codebase for easier redistribution or branding changes.
- refactor (Data): Enriched the `excluded_mods` data in `global_cache` to store the specific `Reason` for exclusion, improving debugging and logging.
- i18n: Added translation keys across all 12 supported languages to ensure full support for the new exclusion messages.

v2.4.0:
- Added: a user prompt that allows displaying the changelog for new script updates on demand.
- Added: support for a new API to check for ModsUpdater updates.
- Added: Improved console output with clickable links and better-centered text.
- Fixed: Resolved issues with misaligned text in the console display.
- Fixed: Removed unused code and imports for better performance and readability.
- Fixed: Resolved an issue where mods on the exclusion list were not being properly ignored. The program will now correctly skip all excluded mods and will not attempt to check for their updates or download them. The list of excluded mods is now displayed correctly at the start of the scan process.
- Fixed: The program now correctly identifies and displays local mods in the excluded mods list.
- Changed: The game version display has been rephrased for better clarity.

v2.2.2:
- Improved the configuration for the game version. The program now automatically uses the latest version of the game if no specific version is indicated in `config.ini`.
- For clarity, the `config.ini` file now shows 'latest_version' instead of being empty when this option is selected.

v2.2.1:
- Fixed: a bug that caused the application to crash when using the --force-update option on mods that did not have a new version available.
- Fixed: Addressed an issue where progress messages for specific modlist exports (PDF, JSON) would run even when their respective --no- flags were used.
- Fixed: Restructured the export logic to ensure command-line arguments are parsed only once and correctly passed to all export functions.
- Featured: - The `install-modlist` command now shows the name of the mod being downloaded in the progress bar.

v2.2.0:
- Added: --force-update argument: Added a new command-line argument that forces a re-download and re-installation of all mods, even if their versions are already up to date. This is useful for repairing corrupted files or performing a clean install.
- Added: Update date and time are now displayed in updated_mods_changelog.txt
- Added: Added a new command-line argument (--install-mods) to download all mods listed in modlist.json to the designated mods folder.
- Fixed an issue where the warning message for an empty mods directory was not displaying the directory path correctly.
- Fixed: Exported JSON data now correctly lists installed mod's download URL. Previously, the installed_download_url could show the latest available version instead of the exact version you have installed. This has been corrected to ensure the exported data is accurate for all mods, regardless of their update status.
- Fixed and improved mod changelog retrieval. Mod changelog information is now fetched directly from the API.
- Fixed: Adapted API call for game version retrieval. The Vintage Story Mods API no longer prepends a 'v' to game version strings (e.g., v1.20.11 is now 1.20.11).
- Improved: Enhanced configuration file handling by explicitly specifying UTF-8 encoding for both reading and writing config.ini.

v2.1.3:
- Fixed: The download link for ModsUpdater was broken due to a character issue.
- Build System: Migrated the binary creation process from Nuitka to cx_Freeze. This change aims to improve build compatibility and simplify the packaging workflow.

v2.1.2:
- Fixed: Improved the warning message displayed when a directory is found in the Mods folder. It now includes the name of the directory in question, providing clearer context to the user.
- Fixed: get_mod_path: Command line `modspath` argument is now correctly used.
- Updated: ko_KR.json file

v2.1.1:
- Fixed: Ensure mod icons are extracted when PDF export is disabled. The `if not args.no_pdf:` condition was moved within the `export_pdf` module to wrap only the PDF generation steps. This ensures that the icon extraction logic, which runs before PDF generation, is always executed, making icons available for other export formats (like HTML) even if PDF export is skipped.

v2.1.0:
- Fixed (welcome_display): Ensures that the update status message is always displayed. A logic issue prevented the "No new version available" message from being shown.
- Fixed: Correct mod icon is now displayed in the PDF modlist even if a manual update for that mod was skipped.
- Fixed: modlist_json for manual mode: download links were not for the correct version.
- Fixed: Incorrect input values for user responses.
- Fixed: updated_mods_changelog.txt was not being populated correctly for manual download mode.
- Added: Functionality to export the list of installed mods to an HTML file.
- Added: New command-line argument `--no-html` to disable HTML mod list export.
- Added: Display of the maximum game version for mod updates.
- Added: ko_KR.json file (Korean localization).
- Improved: Display of the mod information retrieval progress bar.
- Improved: Display of the mod download progress bar.
- Improved: Display of the PDF creation progress bar.
- Updated: Language files with translations for the HTML export feature and the `--no-html` option.
